I'm excited to share a project that streamlines web application testing: a robust framework integrating Selenium, Pytest, and GitHub Actions. This project provides a scalable and maintainable solution for automated testing, ensuring higher quality software. 🚀

Key technologies and benefits:

* **Selenium:** Automates browser interactions across Chrome 🌐, Firefox 🔥, Safari 🍎, and Edge  Edge.
* **Pytest:** A versatile Python testing framework that simplifies test writing ✅ and execution 🏃.
* **GitHub Actions:** Enables continuous integration ⚙️, automating tests with every code change 🔄.

This project demonstrates how to:

* Set up efficient testing workflows 🛠️.
* Improve test coverage 💯.
* Accelerate feedback loops ⚡.
* Enhance collaboration between development 🧑‍💻 and testing teams 👩‍💻.

I invite you to explore the repository, contribute 🤝, and adapt it to your needs. Let's connect 🔗 and discuss how we can leverage automation to build better web applications 🏗️.
