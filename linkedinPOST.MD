I'm excited to share a project that streamlines web application testing: a robust framework integrating Selenium, Pytest, and GitHub Actions. This project provides a scalable and maintainable solution for automated testing, ensuring higher quality software. 🚀

Key technologies and benefits:

* **Selenium:** Automates browser interactions across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
* **Pytest:** A versatile Python testing framework that simplifies test writing and execution.
* **GitHub Actions:** Enables continuous integration, automating tests with every code change.

This project demonstrates how to:

* Set up efficient testing workflows.
* Improve test coverage.
* Accelerate feedback loops.
* Enhance collaboration between development and testing teams.

I invite you to explore the repository, contribute, and adapt it to your needs. Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage automation to build better web applications.
